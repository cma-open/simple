"""Workflow for the simple analysis system."""

# KISS !

# note distinction python called vs command line at terminal

# system dependencies
# installed into appropriate location or environment

# step 0 (optional)
# -----------------

# user confirms or edits the system config
# this determines data and scratch (temp) directories
# log settings to file
# link to notes / discussion / issue
# if config setting should be committed as part of the repo?, separate repo?

# step 1
# ------

# create basic netcdf, CF compliant, with simple data content
# write to file (as specified by config)

# step 2
# ------

# view netcdf content
# describe content in high detailed, labeled, very descriptive


# step 3
# ------

# test netcdf compliance - both tools


# step x
# ------

# run cli tool X  to take user input and return analysis output to the terminal

# step y
# ------

# ? AMEND
# amend cli tool, or another to  take user input, conduct analysis and write to netcdf
# write netcdf to outputs dir
# log process, including record user inputs
